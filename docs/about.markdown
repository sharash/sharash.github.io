My name is Arash, and I work as a bioinformatician, which means I get to apply machine learning and statistics on big biomedical datasets on a daily basis. It’s fun! But I have many other interests as well. I’ve started this blog as an outlet for some of my other interests and learning projects.

You can reach me on ccc.
