<img style="float: right;" src="/images/about/head.jpg" width="200">

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Avida Finance](https://www.avidafinance.com/en/start/), leading the company's risk modeling efforts. Through statistical modeling, building tooling and systems, and coordinating cross-functional efforts around data and models, I help Avida evaluate credit risk accurately and at scale.

Before Avida, I was a bioinformatician at the [Cambridge Stem Cell Institute](https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), which means I got to apply machine learning and statistics to cutting-edge biomedical research on a daily basis.

During my time in academia I enjoyed a number of highly inter-disciplinary collaborations which resulted in [several peer-reviewed scientific publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Q_iGdrkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Furthermore, I am the author and maintainer of the [ClustAssess R package](https://github.com/Core-Bioinformatics/ClustAssess), which enables high-resolution evaluation of clustering results.

When I'm not solving real-world problems with ML, I invest in team-building from recruitment through integration: I have developed skills tests for recruitment and interviewed candidates, trained the wider machine learning community, as well as provided long-term supervision and mentoring of junior group members. I am also passionate about education and pedagogy for machine learning and related quantitative skills.
