<img style="float: right;" src="/images/about/head.jpg" width="200">

I'm a bioinformatician at the [Cambridge Stem Cell Institute](https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), which means I get to apply machine learning and statistics to cutting-edge biomedical research on a daily basis.

My extensive experience with large-scale biomedical data science has driven my enthusiasm for effective and explainable machine learning for real-world problems, enabling data-driven decision-making. I invest in team-building from recruitment through integration: I have developed skills tests for recruitment and interviewed candidates, trained the wider machine learning community, as well as having provided long-term supervision and mentoring of junior group members. I am also passionate about education and pedagogy for machine learning and related quantitative skills.

During my time in academia I have enjoyed a number of highly inter-disciplinary collaborations which resulted in [several peer-reviewed scientific publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Q_iGdrkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Furthermore, I am the author and maintainer of the [ClustAssess R package](https://github.com/Core-Bioinformatics/ClustAssess), which enables high-resolution evaluation of clustering results.

You can reach me on arash[x]@hotmail.com, where [x] should be replaced by the square root of 73599241.
