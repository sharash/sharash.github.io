## Education
* **M.S. in Complex Adaptive Systems - Chalmers University of Technology** *2016-2019*  
  *Selected Coursework:* Neural Networks, Stochastic Optimization, Information Theory, Dynamical Systems.

* **Exchange Studies - Dongguk University** *Fall 2017*  
  *Selected Coursework:* Multiple View Geometry, Deep Learning.

* **Electrical Engineering - Lund University** *2013-2016*  
  *Selected Coursework:* Multivariable Calculus, Control Theory, Mathematical Statistics, Numerical Analysis.

## Experience
* **Bioinformatician - University of Cambridge** *2019-Present*  
    * Long-term data science work on multiple biomedical projects (60+ datasets for 20+ different projects, typically juggling 4-8 projects at a time), with multiple weekly deliverables.
    * Machine learning and statistics on terabyte-scale datasets,using a broad mix of techniques and tools.
    * Developed [R package ClustAssess](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ClustAssess) from scratch, which I continue to maintain.
    * Involved in entire recruitment pipeline, from designing technical skills test, to selecting candidates for interviews, interviewing and final recruitment decisions.
    * Co-authoring [multiple peer-reviewed scientific publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Q_iGdrkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

* **Volunteer Coding Teacher - Kodcentrum**  2018-2019
    * Teaching coding to classes of ~20 children aged 10-12 from underprivileged areas.
    * Planning and structuring classes, hands-on support to children and other volunteers.
    * Long-term development of the learning platforms and curriculum.

## Teaching and Mentorship
* **Teaching**
    * Developing curriculum and training materials for single-cell data analysis course in Cambridge (2022).
    * Intro to Machine Learning - Lecturing for PhD students and postdocs in Cambridge (2021).
    * Teaching coding to children and developing teaching materials and curriculum at Kodcentrum (2018-2019).


* **Mentorship**
    * Coached Computer Science M.Sc. student through 6-month Cambridge internship with weekly 1-on-1s. Advised and assisted the intern to contribute to open-source software and co-author scientific publication (2021). The person is now joining the group as a full-time employee.
    * Onboarded 8 junior group members in Cambridge and created code, documentation, pipelines and workflows to accelerate their integration into the work environment.
